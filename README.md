These Jupyter notebooks demonstrate the data integration of EPA and Purple air sensor data and plume simulation results, using the Gaussian Process regression, for mapping the air quality index over space. 

1. Define the grid and domain for spatial estimation
2. Download EPA air quality data
3. Download Purple air quality data
4. Download plume simulation maps
5. Interpolate EPA air quality data
6. Interpolate Purple air quality data
7. Integrate EPA and Purple air quality data
8. Integrate EPA, Purple air, and plume simulation data
